Problem:
player place an 'X' or an 'O' on a 3 X 3 board. The first to get 3 X's or
O's in a row whens. If all boxes are filled and no one has won than the
game is a tie.

Sudocode:
1. Display the initial empty 3X3 board
2. Ask the user to mark a square
3. Computer marks a square
4. Display update board
5. If winner, display winner
6. If board full, display "tie"
7. If neither winner nor full, go to #2
8. Play again?
9. If yes, go to #1
10. Good bye!
