1. '!=' is the opposite of '==' and is used when comparing two objects.
2. '! before' is used on an object to reverse its boolean equivalent.
3. '! after' This sometimes means a method is destructive, but
  it's part of a method name and not syntax so you can't be certain.
4. '?' Is the ternary if, else. so number.even? ? puts "true" : puts "false"
5. '?' By convention this usually means a method returns a boolean, but again
  this isn't ruby syntax so it's best to check first.
6. '!!' Turns an object into its boolean equivalent.
