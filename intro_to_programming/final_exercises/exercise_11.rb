After looking at a few, I've decided I would gravitate more toward
api.rubyonrails.org. While my mind may change as I develop
my skills, it seems to be well organized for easy browsing and 
each module, class, etc. seems to be well documented. My second 
choice, if ever needed, would be apidock.com/ruby.
